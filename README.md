# Test Homepage for Rooster Grin

This project is deployed on AWS Amplify at this [link](https://main.d14svrrufh58c2.amplifyapp.com/).

I did a React-based project due to my familiarity with it, using primarily Javascript, React-Bootstrap components, and .scss for styling.  

I chose React-Bootstrap because I thought I would like the Carousel component more than I did, but I ended up writing my own.  I would probably have taken that approach across the whole project if I had a redo.  I also think Typescript would have made more sense with some of the implementation decisions I made.

I chose to host on AWS Amplify because I felt like I should do something with my AWS account, and it turned out to be quite easy.

The biggest difficulty was styling with Bootstrap (how the framework does columns, how to make them not run into each other, ::before and ::after displays messing up my grid, etc.).

I quite enjoyed:

1. Playing around with css animations, which I never had spent much time doing.
2. Looking at the app hosting offered by Amplify and Github Pages.
