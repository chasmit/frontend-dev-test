# Test Homepage for Rooster Grin

This project is deployed on AWS Amplify at this [link](https://main.d14svrrufh58c2.amplifyapp.com/).

## Write-up

### 1

I did a React-based project due to my familiarity with the framework, using Javascript, React-Bootstrap components, and .scss for styling.  

I chose React-Bootstrap because I thought I would like the Carousel component more than I did, but I ended up writing my own.

I chose to host on AWS Amplify because I already had the AWS account, and it turned out to be quite easy.

### 2

The biggest difficulty was styling with Bootstrap (how the framework does columns, how to make them not run into each other, ::before and ::after displays messing up my grid, etc.).  The mobile responsiveness was also new to me.

### 3

I quite enjoyed:

1. Playing around with css animations, which I never had spent much time doing, because it's fun.
2. Looking at the app hosting offered by Amplify and Github Pages, because it turned out to be a painless process and a good thing to learn.
3. Implementing ways of rendering components with map() that allows scalability and using conditional styling with that, because it's satisfying as a programmer.
